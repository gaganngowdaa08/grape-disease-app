 🔍 Diagnose grape leaf diseases using AI — fast, accurate, and accessible.

📌 Overview
This web application uses a trained deep learning model to detect grape leaf diseases from uploaded images. Built with **Flask**, it offers a clean UI and fast inference, making it ideal for agricultural diagnostics and research applications.

 🚀 Features
- 🧠 AI-powered predictions** using a custom-trained model  
- 📷 Image upload interface** for leaf analysis  
- 📊 Real-time results** with disease classification  
- 🌐 Deployed on Render** for easy access  
- 🛠️ Modular Flask backend** with clean routing and templates

✅ Step 6: How It Works
🧠 How It Works
1. User uploads an image of a grape leaf.
2. The image is preprocessed and passed to the trained model.
3. The model predicts the disease class.
4. The result is displayed instantly on the web interface.
